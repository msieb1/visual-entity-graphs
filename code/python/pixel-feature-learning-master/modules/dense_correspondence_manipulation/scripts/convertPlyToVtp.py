'''
Usage:

directorPython convertPlyToVtp.py <path/to/data.ply>

This script will read the ply file and save a vtp file.
The output vtp file will be given the same name as the
input file with the ply extension replaced with vtp.

Note, the ply file needs to be in ascii format and not
binary.  The vtk ply reader seems to crash on binary
ply files.  You can use meshlab to open a binary ply
file and re-save it as an ascii ply file.
